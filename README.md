# Data Science OER Guide: Geosciences üåê

This repository offers a **curated collection of metadata** - that is, organized links and brief descriptions pointing to platforms that help geoscientists easily discover **open educational resources (OER)**,¬¥or directly to such individual training materials related to data science. The emphasis is on data-science workflows using geoscience data.

The goal of this repository is to promote access to learning opportunities, reduce redundancy in training material development, and support reproducible, open science in the geosciences.

Additional sources of OERs not directly listed in this repository include YouTube channels and peer-reviewed scientific journals (e.g., tutorial-style articles or methods papers).

## Learning platforms & educational hubs

These platforms provide access to OERs at the intersection of geosciences and data science. Some are dedicated to geoscience-specific content, while others are multidisciplinary and contain relevant resources. Many allow filtering by keywords such as `geoscience`, `hydrology`, or `remote sensing`.
